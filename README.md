The_Decline
===========

The game is seperated into projects. The -main project is where all the development code goes.
To build to a platform you right click on its project and do run-as from there.
No generic code goes in the platform projects. 
  I think you can do some platform specific stuff in there but for the most part everything goes in -main.
***The only excemption from this is all the assets like textures goes in the androids asset folder.
